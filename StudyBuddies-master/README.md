StudyBuddies

StudyBuddies’ is a mobile application to ease the user’s classwork by providing a student-to-student resource for studying, or working on material from a specific class. The rationale behind this system is that users will be able to make a more efficient use of their time by being provided with a system that will: introduce them to other users from the same class, provide a Q&A system that will be specific for a certain class, and allow the user to create/view study-groups for more task-specific purposes.

Limitations
-There is no cloud backend support. We offer the ability to save favorites and username to shared preferences. If we were to implement the cloud backend we would have saved the classes to the cloud and that would have been it, because the users would have taken care of everything else. 
-Would like to have come up with a better ranking procedure. 
-Messaging feature in study-groups is not an actual functioning messaging system
