CS1635 Designing, Prototyping and Evaluating Mobile Interfaces

StudyBuddies

Task 1 - Easy: Add a group to users favorites. Requires navigating to a class home page and then pressing the heart-shaped button to add the class to their favorites.

Task 2 - Medium: Answer a question, then view the answered question. Requires navigating to a class home page, selecting the "Answer a Question" button then entering an answer. Then choosing the "View Recent Answers" button from the class home page and checking the answer.

Task 3 - Hard: Create a study-group. Requires the user to select the "Study Groups" button from a class home page then selecting the "+" button and entering custom attributes for the study group.

Limitations
-There is no cloud backend support. We offer the ability to save favorites and username to shared preferences. If we were to implement the cloud backend we would have saved the classes to the cloud and that would have been it, because the users would have taken care of everything else. 
-Would like to have come up with a better ranking procedure. 
-Messaging feature in study-groups is not an actual functioning messaging system
